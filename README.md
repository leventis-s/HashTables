# Hashtable-C-
Includes Linear Probing Hashtable and Robinhood Hashtable

`LinearProbingHashTable.cpp` takes in strings and a hash 
function and allocates the data throughout a hash table for 
easy lookup.

`RobinHoodHashTable.cpp` does the same but allocates using the 
Robinhood method, optimizing runtime.
